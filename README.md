## Digital-Data-Dashboard

### About project: 
The Digital Data Dashboard is a report created in the Power BI service to analyse the performance of activities on social media such as Amazon, Meta or Google Ads. The data presented in the report has no real representation. The report consists of two versions of tabs: dark and light (your choice depending on your preferences)

Two files have been included in the repository:

    1. Digital Data Dashboard.pdf - this is a pdf where you can see what the dashboard looks like. 

    2. Digital Data Dashboard.pbix - this is a version of the dashboard kept in the original downloadable file format so that you can open it in your local version of Power BI.

    3. Metrics documentation - this is the documentation of all, the metrics used in the dashboard including the code to create them.
